# Transfer-Learning-DIO
 Bean Classification with Transfer Learning In this project, we apply Transfer Learning using the InceptionV3 pre-trained model to classify images from the Beans dataset into three categories: Healthy, Angular Leaf Spot and Bean Rust. The objective was to create an efficient model to identify diseases in beans from high-quality images.
